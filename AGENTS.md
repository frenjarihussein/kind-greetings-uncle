- Cashier account types live in profiles.account_kind; AppShell routes non-standard kinds to their own tab set (CASHIER_TABS) — keeps cashiers out of the full menu.
- Per-user UI choices (notification kinds, dashboard tiles) are stored in public.user_prefs as jsonb — one row per user, no schema change per new option.
